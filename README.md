# DataVisualization - Exploring 120 years of the modern age Olympic games.  
### A web application using dash to be deployed using heroku.  

App is live on heroku and can be interacted with here: (performance constraints exist since it's running on free tier)  
http://olympic-games-120years.herokuapp.com/  
  
## Motivation:  
As the Olympic games of 2020 were aproaching, we decided a tribute to the most important event in sports was due.   
This was before the pandemic would come and disrupt the 2020 edition.  
  
## Objectives:  
The application explores 2 datasets on the first 120 years of the modern age Olympic games.  
Top Athletes and Top Countries by total medals can be seen, as additional information, that can be filtered and interacted with.  
Since this was a 2 days project, focused on interactive app building and visualization concepts, no optimization for data and calculations were done.  
  
### Remarks:  
Significant performance improvements are easily achievable by pre-calculating and pre-selecting data, still this was not the goal.  
  
Maybe for future work.  
  
We had fun building this:
